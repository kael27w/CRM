# Note Saving Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The note saving functionality was failing because the database schema doesn't support a `call_sid` column in the `activities` table, but the code was trying to insert it.

## Root Cause
The error message showed:
```
"Could not find the 'call_sid' column of 'activities' in the schema"
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `client/src/lib/api.ts`
- **Removed `call_sid` field** from the `NewNoteData` type since the database doesn't support it
- **Added `owner_id` field** which is required by the database schema
- Updated the `createNoteActivity` function to match the corrected type

### 2. Updated `client/src/components/Softphone.tsx`
- **Modified saveMutation** to not include `call_sid` in the API payload
- **Added `owner_id: 1`** to the note payload (defaulting to user ID 1)
- **Added `title` field** with timestamp for better note identification
- Kept `call_sid` in the local mutation data for logging purposes but don't send to API

### 3. Updated `server/routes.ts`
- **Removed `call_sid` handling** from the POST `/api/activities` route
- **Added logging** when `call_sid` is provided but not stored
- **Cleaned up the note creation logic** to only handle supported database fields

### 4. Fixed Vite Configuration
- **Updated proxy target** from `http://localhost:3001` to `http://localhost:3002` to match the server port

## Database Schema Requirements
Based on the `activities` table schema, the required fields for note creation are:
- `contact_id` (number) - Required
- `type` ('note') - Required  
- `description` (string) - Required
- `title` (string) - Optional but recommended
- `owner_id` (number) - Required (defaults to 1)

## Expected Result
After these fixes:
1. ✅ Contact lookup during calls should work correctly
2. ✅ Save Note button should be enabled when there's text and an active contact
3. ✅ Notes should save successfully to the database
4. ✅ Notes should appear in the contact's activity history
5. ✅ No more database schema errors

## Testing
To test the note saving functionality:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Make a call to a known contact number
3. Verify the contact name appears
4. Type a note in the textarea
5. Click "Save Note"
6. Check the contact's activity history to see the saved note

## Additional Test Script
A test script `test-note-save.js` has been created to verify the API functionality independently.
