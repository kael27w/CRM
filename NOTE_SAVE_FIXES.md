# Note Saving Fixes Summary

## Issue Identified
The note saving functionality was failing because the database schema doesn't support an `owner_id` column in the `activities` table, but the code was trying to insert it.

## Root Cause
The error message showed:
```
"Could not find the 'owner_id' column of 'activities' in the schema cache"
```

This indicates that the actual Supabase database table doesn't have an `owner_id` column, even though the TypeScript schema definition includes it.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `client/src/lib/api.ts`
- **Removed `call_sid` field** from the `NewNoteData` type since the database doesn't support it
- **Removed `owner_id` field** since the actual database doesn't have this column
- Updated the `createNoteActivity` function to match the corrected type

### 2. Updated `client/src/components/Softphone.tsx`
- **Modified saveMutation** to not include `call_sid` or `owner_id` in the API payload
- **Added `title` field** with timestamp for better note identification
- Kept `call_sid` in the local mutation data for logging purposes but don't send to API

### 3. Updated `server/routes.ts`
- **Removed `call_sid` handling** from the POST `/api/activities` route
- **Added logging** when `call_sid` is provided but not stored
- **Cleaned up the note creation logic** to only handle supported database fields

### 4. Fixed Vite Configuration
- **Updated proxy target** from `http://localhost:3001` to `http://localhost:3002` to match the server port

## Database Schema Requirements
Based on the actual working database, the required fields for note creation are:
- `contact_id` (number) - Required
- `type` ('note') - Required  
- `description` (string) - Required
- `title` (string) - Optional but recommended

**Note**: The `owner_id` field is NOT required and causes errors if included.

## Expected Result
After these fixes:
1. ✅ Contact lookup during calls should work correctly
2. ✅ Save Note button should be enabled when there's text and an active contact
3. ✅ Notes should save successfully to the database without owner_id errors
4. ✅ Notes should appear in the contact's activity history
5. ✅ No more database schema errors

## Testing
To test the note saving functionality:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Make a call to a known contact number
3. Verify the contact name appears
4. Type a note in the textarea
5. Click "Save Note"
6. Check the contact's activity history to see the saved note

## Additional Test Scripts
- `test-note-save.js` - Original test script (may fail due to owner_id)
- `test-note-save-fixed.js` - Updated test script without owner_id field

## Latest Fix (Owner ID Issue)
**Problem**: The code was trying to insert `owner_id` field but the actual Supabase database doesn't have this column.

**Solution**: Completely removed `owner_id` from note creation. The database appears to work fine without this field, suggesting it's either:
- Not actually required in the real database
- Has a default value
- The schema definition doesn't match the actual database structure
